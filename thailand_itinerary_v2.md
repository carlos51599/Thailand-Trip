| ⚖️ **Experience balance** | Culture (temples, Songkran) → Nature (mountains, jungle) → Beach (islands, diving)                       |
| 🎒 **Pace**               | 2-4 nights per stop = time to explore without burnout                                                    |

## 🌦️ Weather & Climate Guide

### April–May Weather Overview

Your trip spans the **transition from hot/dry season to early monsoon**. Here's what to expect:

| Location          | Temperature        | Rainfall     | Humidity | Conditions                       |
| ----------------- | ------------------ | ------------ | -------- | -------------------------------- |

| **Krabi/Ao Nang** | 28-34°C (82-93°F)  | Increasing   | 75-85%   | Monsoon building late April      |
| **Koh Phi Phi**   | 28-33°C (82-91°F)  | Moderate     | 80-85%   | May: afternoon showers likely    |

| **Khao Sok**      | 26-34°C (79-93°F)  | Moderate     | 80-90%   | Jungle = more rain possible      |

### 🌧️ What the Rain Means

| Reality                   | Tips                                                  |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| "Monsoon" ≠ constant rain | Typically short, intense afternoon bursts (1-2 hours) |
| Mornings usually clear    | Schedule outdoor activities early                     |
| Rain brings relief        | Cools things down significantly                       |
| Islands still accessible  | Tours run unless severe weather                       |
| Fewer crowds              | Shoulder season = better prices, less tourists        |

### 📅 Monthly Comparison

| Factor     | April                              | May                       |
| ---------- | ---------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| **Heat**   | Peak hot season (especially north) | Slightly cooler with rain |
| **Rain**   | Minimal north, starting south      | Increasing everywhere     |
| **Crowds** | Songkran = busy north              | Lower season = quieter    |
| **Prices** | Higher during Songkran             | Lower (shoulder season)   |

### 🧥 Packing for Weather

- **Lightweight, breathable clothing** - you'll sweat
- **Light rain jacket or poncho** - for afternoon showers
- **Quick-dry fabrics** - essential
- **Sunscreen SPF 50+** - tropical sun is intense
- **Hat and sunglasses** - mandatory
- **Waterproof bag** - for electronics during rain/boats

### ⚠️ Common Scams & How to Avoid Them

| Scam                     | What Happens                                                           | How to Avoid                                                             |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 🛕 **"Temple Closed"**    | Tuk-tuk driver says temple is closed, offers "better" place (gem shop) | Temples rarely close. Walk to entrance yourself.                         |
| 💎 **Gem Scam**           | "Special government sale" or "invest in gems"                          | NO legitimate gem deals exist. Never buy gems to "resell at home."       |
| 🛺 **Tuk-tuk "Tour"**     | 20 THB all-day tour = stops at commission shops                        | If too cheap, you're the product. Use Grab or agree on price upfront.    |
| 🚕 **Taxi Meter Refusal** | "Meter broken" or flat rate offered                                    | Walk away. Next taxi will use meter. Or use Grab.                        |
| 💵 **Jet Ski Damage**     | Pre-existing damage blamed on you, demand payment                      | Photograph everything before/after. Use reputable operators only.        |
| 🏍️ **Motorbike Scam**     | Passport held as deposit, bike "damaged," huge fee demanded            | Never leave passport. Use reputable rental shops. Photograph bike first. |
| 🍹 **Spiked Drinks**      | Drinks drugged at bars                                                 | Watch your drink. Don't accept drinks from strangers.                    |
| 👔 **Tailor Scams**       | "Special discount today only" → poor quality suits                     | Research tailors beforehand. Don't trust tuk-tuk recommendations.        |

### 🛡️ General Safety Tips

| Category         | Tips                                                                                     |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 🏍️ **Motorbikes** | Wear helmet (required by law). Left-side traffic. Thailand has HIGH road fatality rates. |
| 🏊 **Swimming**   | Respect red flags. Rip currents common. Don't swim after drinking.                       |
| 🌊 **Boats**      | Wear life jacket even if others don't. Check weather before island hopping.              |
| 💊 **Drugs**      | ZERO TOLERANCE. Penalties include death sentence. Don't accept packages from strangers.  |
| 🌙 **Nightlife**  | Stay aware. Ping pong shows often scam tourists with huge bills.                         |
| 📸 **Valuables**  | Hotel safe for passport/excess cash. Waterproof pouch for beach days.                    |
| 🔒 **Bags**       | Cross-body bags. Watch for motorbike bag snatchers (rare but happens).                   |

### 📋 If Something Goes Wrong

1. **Medical emergency:** Call 1669 (ambulance) or go directly to international hospital
2. **Crime/theft:** Call Tourist Police 1155 (English), get police report for insurance
3. **Lost passport:** Contact British Embassy immediately
4. **Natural disaster:** Follow hotel/local authority instructions, contact embassy
5. **Document everything:** Photos, receipts, names for insurance claims
